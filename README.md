Description:
  - A videogame quiz that contains questions regarding to general videogame knowledge and specific titles/series. After the 'Start Quiz'
    button is clicked, then a series of questions will show up with buttons as choices and an overhead timer. A right answer will 
    highlight green, whereas a wrong answer will be red instead. In addition, a wrong answer will reduce the timer by 20 seconds. After
    all the questions has been answered or the timer reaches 0, then the Game Over screen will appear with the user's scores and an
    input form with a submit button. Once the user inputs the form and clicks submits, then the Highscores page will appear with a 
    Leaderboard of the scores, and a 'Play Again' and 'Clear Highscores' button. Also, there's 'View Highscores' button that is  
    available anytime to access the highscores screen.
  - The videogame quiz and the website is done through HTML, CSS, and Javascript code in Visual Studio Code, and utilizes
    Bootstrap with its components and utilities. The css file contains standard css practices and key frames (Searched it up in order
    for my background images to transition by fading in/out), and there were 2 javascript files. The first javascript file 
    (script-questions.js) contains my quiz content of answers and choices, whereas the second javascript file contains variables 
    (const/let), objects, functions, onclick events, for-loops, and if-else statements.
  
 Technologies:
  - Visual Studio Code
  - HTML, CSS, Javascript/jQuery
  - Bootstrap
  
  Challenges:
  - This was another challenging homework, but it was definitely worth the experience to do. I spent a lot of my time reading through
    documentation and watching lecture videos in order for me to work my way up in doing this homework. There were times that were 
    frustrating because some specific parts of the code wouldn't work, but eventually I was able to pull through and fix it.
  - Like the last homework, most of the difficulty was in the javascript code, but this time I opted for jQuery syntax because we
    were learning it during the week I did this homework. The main problem I had was trying to code the logic in order as they appear,
    and I ran into several problems with functions in general. The only thing that I still wasn't able to wrap my head around is the
    difference between $(this) and event.target, and I spent about 2+ hours trying to make it so that my button-choices were only  
    targeted, but I gave up and decided on event.target.html().
  - I definitely have learned a lot in regards to javascript and jQuery after I finished this homework.
  - I was able to solve each of my problem through persistent effort, patience, time management, and using my online resources!
